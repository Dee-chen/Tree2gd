Tree2gd
=====================
Tree2GD provides an integrated pipeline to identify WGD events, with friendful commands in one-step or multiple steps,
with smart quality control in custom dataset, with multithreading design costing low time, with well performance in detect WGD signals,
and with advanced visualization of GDs and Ks peaks.


Python Requirements
===================
We currently recommend using Python 3.8 from http://www.python.org
Tree2GD is currently supported and tested on the following Python
implementations:

- Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 -- see http://www.python.org

- Pip3.6>=v19.2.3 -- see https://pypi.org/project/pip/
Installing by ``sudo apt-get install python3-pip`` or with get-pip.py using::

   curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
   python3 get-pip.py

R Requirements
===================
In order to complete the final drawing result displayï¼ŒWe currently recommend using R>=v4.0.0
from https://www.r-project.org

Installation
===================
Installation From Pypi
-------------------
You can quickly install Tree2gd through the following command, 
and automatically install the python packages it depends on by run::
    pip3 install Tree2gd [--user]  #You may need the --user parameter if you do not have administrator rights
If you need to use a specific python3 path to install and use Tree2gd, you can replace the above ``pip3`` with ``/THE/PATH/OF/YOUR/PYTHON3 -m pip``

Installation From Source
-------------------
You can download and decompress our source code, or fetch it using git.
Now change directory to the Tree2gd source code folder and run::
    python3 setup.py build
    python3 setup.py test
    python3 setup.py install [--user] #You may need the --user parameter if you do not have administrator rights



Testing
===================
After the installation is successful, the main program command ``Tree2gd`` and test command ``Tree2gd_test`` will be added to your system.
You can first check whether Tree2gd is installed successfully by running the following command::
   $ Tree2gd -h
If the system feeds back its corresponding parameter description, congratulations on the correct installation of Tree2gd to your system!
Next, we **strongly recommend** that you run ``Tree2gd_test`` to use the data we have prepared for a quick and complete Tree2gd test, because you can get the following benefits:
   1.Check whether the pre-compiled version of the software we use by default is suitable for your system, and replace the unavailable ones with the configuration file (see the following instructions for configuration).  
   
   2.When using for the first time, in the final drawing part, we will spend a few minutes to install several dependent packages in R. After that, the formal use will be faster and more convenient.  
   
   3.After the user modifies the configuration file, you can add own new settings through the ``-config`` parameter of the command to test, and quickly detect that the new configuration can run successfully.

The ``Tree2gd_test`` command will run the complete analysis process with the fastest parameter settings.
It only contains two optional parameters command::
   $ Tree2gd_test [-t] [-config]
      -t [int] sets the number of threads for testing (default: 1)
      -config [str] uses the configuration given by the user File for testing (verify availability of custom configuration)
In the case of 4 cpus, it takes about 5 minutes to complete a round of testing (the first run will take some extra time to download and install the R package). After successful operation,
it will generate a folder in the current directory``./Tree2gd_test_out``, You can check it (especially the final drawing result ``Tree2GD.result.pdf`` in step6) to fully verify the running effect of the software.

Running
===================
You can complete all WGD analysis only with the simplest commands below and get a perfect drawing display:
    $ Tree2gd -i input_dir -tree phytree.nwk
Among them, ``phytree.nwk`` is the species evolution tree in newick format.

The ``input_dir`` folder contains all the corresponding protein sequences (default postfix .pep) and cds sequences (default postfix .cds) of each species contained in phytree.nwk by fasta format.

In addition, you can add the following optional parameters to make the program run faster and better (especially when using multi-core operation)::
  -t T               Thread num.default:1.
  -o O               The output dir.default:output.
  -s O               The output dir.default:output.
  -step STEP         which step you needs.
  -log LOG           log file name, or log will print on stdout.
  -config CONFIG     config.ini configuration file, leave it blank to run with default parameters and the program's own software version.
  -debug             The log file will contain the output of each software itself, which is convenient for finding errors (-log is required).
  -only_script       Only generate scripts, not run automatically.
  -cds2tree          Use cds sequence to construct gene tree.
